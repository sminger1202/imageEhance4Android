ECLIPSE ANDROID PROJECT IMPORT SUMMARY
======================================

Ignored Files:
--------------
The following files were *not* copied into the new Gradle project; you
should evaluate whether these are still needed in your project and if
so manually move them:

* AndroidManifest.xml
* assets/
* assets/xposed_init
* ic_launcher-web.png
* proguard-project.txt
* res/
* res/drawable-hdpi/
* res/drawable-hdpi/ic_launcher.png
* res/drawable-mdpi/
* res/drawable-mdpi/ic_launcher.png
* res/drawable-xhdpi/
* res/drawable-xhdpi/ic_launcher.png
* res/drawable-xxhdpi/
* res/drawable-xxhdpi/ic_launcher.png
* res/layout/
* res/layout/activity_demo.xml
* res/values/
* res/values/dimens.xml
* res/values/strings.xml
* res/values/styles.xml

Moved Files:
------------
Android Gradle projects use a different directory structure than ADT
Eclipse projects. Here's how the projects were restructured:

* lib/XposedBridgeApi-54.jar => xposedHookDemo/lib/XposedBridgeApi-54.jar
* src/ => xposedHookDemo/src/main/java/

Next Steps:
-----------
You can now build the project. The Gradle project needs network
connectivity to download dependencies.

Bugs:
-----
If for some reason your project does not build, and you determine that
it is due to a bug or limitation of the Eclipse to Gradle importer,
please file a bug at http://b.android.com with category
Component-Tools.

after import once you are satisfied with the results.)
